# About this mod  
Lets you customize the size, position, and even rotation and grid layout of the various HUD elements.  


This mod lets you adjust the following properties of the HUD UI elements:  
- position - by dragging with a modifier key (default left ctrl) and hotkey (default left mouse button, a.k.a button 0)  
- scale - by editing the config file  
- items per row (for the toolbar) - by editing the config file  
- rotation (for the health and food bars) - by editing the config file (only accepts multiples of 90)  

## UI Elements Affected
- Mini Map  
- Food and Health Bars  
- Toolbar  
- Status Effects  
- Guardian Power Display  

## UI Elements Not Yet Affected
- Cross hairs  
- UI Messages  
- Key Hints Panel  
- etc.  

## Notes
This mod is provisionally compatible with Equipment and Quick Slots; it detaches the quick slots from the health bar and lets you move them like any other element. Hopefully they still work as intended.

## Config
A config file BepInEx/config/aedenthorn.CustomUI.cfg is created after running the game once with this mod.  
You can adjust the config values by editing this file using a text editor or in-game using the Config Manager.  
To reload the config from the config file, type `customui reset` into the game's console (F5).  

## Technical
To install this mod, the easiest way is to just use Vortex, the Nexus Mods mod manager. It should take care of all dependencies.  
To install manually, place the dll file in the BepInEx/plugins folder. You will need BepInEx.
